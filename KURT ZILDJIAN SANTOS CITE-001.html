            <P>I am Kurt, as I have said in my introduction. I am currently a BSIT Sophomore. I am currently studying at the Technological Institute of the Philippines.</P>
            <br>
            <p>I am currently 20 years old and I live at Pasig City, Philippines. My Hobbies are playing competitive video games and playing the Bass guitar, I have served as the Sponsorships and Opportunities Deputy and Lorso Representative for Tempest Gaming Society, TIP Manila for A.Y. 
                '23 - '24. I was also in their player roster for League of Legends, and competed in various tournaments with the roster, representing TIP. Currently, I have taken a step back from extra curricular activities to focus on my studies.

            <h3>UPDATE!</h3>

            <p> Hello, it's been a minute! I have learned so much from my time being a freshman. Now that I am a sophomore, I am done romanticizing everything with college life. The commute life is brutal and 4 hours of it everyday has been burning me out. The fact that as soon as classes end my first priority is getting home is a testament, that college has really made me introverted haha!
                But it's been a thrill, meeting new friends and experiencing new stuff, I'm looking forward to more of everything!

            </p>
